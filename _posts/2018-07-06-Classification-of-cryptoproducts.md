I am a big fan of classification theorems: [finite simple groups classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_of_finite_simple_groups), [compact complex surfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enriques%E2%80%93Kodaira_classification), [exotic spheres classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_sphere#Classification). It is difficult to refrain from the temptation to formulate your own.

##### Tokens & currencies



* A token issued by any startup (selling equity to VC investors in form of tokens has the property of instant liquidity)

* A token issued by any product that has high infrastructure costs --- e.g. Telegram (with DLT, you can incentivize people to bear the infrastructure costs themselves)

* A token issued by any (in some cases privacy-preserving) product that needs to store sensitive data --- e.g. medical book record

* A utility token --- e.g. SONM, Gnosis, Storjcoin

* A security token (debenture token, smart swap contract, option token, equity token, bond token or smart futures contract)

* Tokens backed by something --- by USD (Tether, MakerDAO), by BTC, by ETH, by EOS, by natural asset tokens (gold, oil, natural gas, fuel oil, and base metals)

* Assets in VR

* A token issued by any product that has network rules constructed the way that it is possible but unprofitable to violate them 

* A novel protocol with its native currency (that is somehow better than existing ones --- interoperable, scalable, smart contract capable, customizable, multi asset, multi industry, public but with private functionality)
